This plugin uses 'Tie::Handle' mechanism to create two output handles: VIMOUT and VIMERR. Then standard output is
associated with VIMOUT. This allows normal use of 'print' and 'printf' operators:

	:perl << EOP
		print 'Line:', $curwin->(Cursor())[0];
		printf '%d:%d", $curwin->Cursor();
		print VIMERR "Error: $!";
	EOP

Value in $, is handled correctly:
	
	:perl $, = '; ';
	:perl print 'a' .. 'e'; # prints 'a; b; c; d; e'

Value in $\ is ignored and  there is no buffering, so it works as if $\ was set to "\n":

	:perl print 'one'; print 'two' 
	
prints same as 
	
	:perl print "one\ntwo"
